# DrumKit Game

Welcome to the DrumKit Game repository! This project is a JavaScript-based interactive drum kit game that allows users to play virtual drums using their keyboard or mouse. It was developed as a module challenge following my completion of the JavaScript DOM module in the Web Development Bootcamp course with Angela Yu.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser of your choice.
3. Use your keyboard or mouse to play the drums. Each drum sound is associated with a specific key or button on the screen.
4. Enjoy the drumming experience and create your own rhythms!
